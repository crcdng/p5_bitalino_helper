# P5 BITalino-helper

A helper class for using [Processing](https://processing.org) with [BITalino](http://bitalino.com/en/).

First connect your BITalino via Bluetooth / BLE.

To use the BITalino class, start with one of the examples. Alternatively, open a new sketch in Processing, then drag and drop `Bitalino.pde` from the `dist` folder onto the window.

Currently, BITalino Revolution is supported.

See `VERSIONS.md` for more info about the roadmap and planned features.
